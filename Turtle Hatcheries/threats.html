            </header>
                <p>Human activities have shifted the odds against the survival of these ancient seafarers during the past 200 years. Sea turtles are killed for their eggs, flesh, skin, and shells, and they are overfished and subject to poaching.</p>

                    <h1>Overharvesting and Illegal trade.</h1>
                    <p>Hawksbill sea turtles are now classified as severely endangered due to their gold and brown shells, which are used to make jewelry and other high-end goods. They are particularly in danger along the Caribbean Coast and Indian and Pacific Oceans. Scientists believe that hawksbill populations have decreased by 90% in the past 100 years.</p>

                    <h1>Habitat loss.</h1>
                    <p>Sea turtles are in danger all over the world; several species are in risk of going extinct right now. Although the turtles' natural habitat consists of the three temperate oceans, their populations have lately decreased for a number of reasons. There is no proof that the population is declining due to natural causes; the only things that might attack an adult huge turtle are sharks, large fish, crocodiles, killer whales, and rarely octopi. But a wide range of fish and crab species eat young turtles.</p>

                    <h1>Pollution</h1>
                    <p>At every stage of development, from eggs to hatchlings to adolescents to adults, sea turtles are susceptible to ocean pollution. Toxic metals, PCBs, petroleum products, and agricultural and industrial runoff are examples of pollutants. They may hurt you right away or accumulate in tissues and inhibit your immune system, which can make you sick and even die.</p>
